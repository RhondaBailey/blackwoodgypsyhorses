        <section className="breedContent">
        <p>Some people are just born with a love of horses.  Tori is one of those people.  As a child, she never played with dolls.  Sure she had Barbies and she had a doll house, but she always played with the horses that came with them and never the dolls themselves.  The only books she wanted to read were horse related books.  Rhonda, who always loved horses as a kid but whose family couldnâ€™t afford to give her a horse or riding lessons wanted to make sure that Tori was able to fulfill her dreams of having horses in her life.  Tori started riding at the age of 8.  For the first few years the family half leased a couple different horses for her to learn on.  She got her first at age 11.  A Thoroughbred mare named Beauty. </p> 

        <p>As Tori got older and got her first computer, her favorite past time was looking at horse photos and learning all she could about the different breeds on the internet.  One evening, Rhonda came home from work to find a very excited Tori waiting for her by the door.  She kept talking about seeing the most beautiful horse she had ever seen, a Gypsy Vanner, and she needed to show it to Rhonda right away.  That horse was a young Taskin.  Tori instantly became obsessed with Gypsies and set out to learn everything she could with the hope that someday she would own one of her own.</p>

        <p>Fast forward to 2014, Tori became very ill with a major heart problem that required a long hospital stay to cure an infection in the hear and eventually open heart surgery.  That was the year that Tori had decided that now was the time to make the dream a reality.  Her Christmas gift that year was the money to put a downpayment on her first Gypsy.  A yearling colt name Maximus Roman.  By July 2015, Max was finally on his way home to Tori.  </p>

        <p>In May of 2015, Tori took Max to the Mt. Hood Gypsy and Drum Horse show at the Oregon State Fairgrounds.  There she met Samantha and CJ Vansickle of Starfire Gypsy Horses.  Two weeks later, she traveled to CA to attend a show with Starfire.  When she arrived at the ranch, who should be there but the one and only Taskin.  The horse that stated it all.  Over the next few years, Tori moved to CA to be a full-time apprentice at Starfire and during that time, she not only got to work with Taskin and show him but she worked with many other amazing gypsy horses all under the tutelage of Sam and CJ, two of the best in the business.</p>

        <div><h2>About the Breed</h2>
        <section className="breedContent">
            <p>The Gypsy Vanner/Gypsy Horse is a small draft horse originally bred by the Romani people of 
            Great Britain and Ireland. They were breeding to create the perfect horse to pull their 
            living wagons known as vardos or caravans. In the 1990s the breed was first brought 
            to North America.</p>

            <p>The genetic origins of the breed include the Shire, the Clydesdale, and the native British 
            ponies such as the Dales pony. Known for its broad body type of heavy bone, the majority 
            of the breed stands between just 14-15 hands at the withers. They come in any color, solid, tobiano 
            and splash and should have an abundance of feather flowing from behind the knees and hocks, as 
            well as the long free flowing mane and tail. They also known for their calm, friendly, and 
            often playful temperament as they were bred to be family horses.</p>

            <p>Though originally bred to pull the caravans, you will see them in all disciplines such as 
            driving, dressage, jumping, English 
            pleasure, ranch work, trail, and western pleasure horses. </p>

            <p>For more information about the breed's history and breed standards, visit the <a href="http://vanners.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gypsy Vanner Horse Society</a>.</p>
